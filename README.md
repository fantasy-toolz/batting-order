## Batting Orders, drawn from MLB data
### Fantasy Toolz

This repository collects the batting order of each team for each game by automatically analysing the MLB statcast data. Each team has a csv file in the `data/[year]/` directory, which is update each morning with the previous day's games.

There are also analysis scripts that are periodically run to create aggregated content for the [Fantasy Toolz webpage](https://fantasy-toolz.github.io).

We have historical data from the 2022 season onwards available. If you want an earlier season, please contact us.
