Team,Lineup1,Lineup2,Lineup3,Lineup4,Lineup5,Lineup6,Lineup7,Lineup8,Lineup9,Lineup10,Lineup11,
CWS,Tim Anderson,Andrew Benintendi,Luis Robert,Eloy Jimenez,Andrew Vaughn,Yoan Moncada,Leury Garcia,Gavin Sheets,Yasmani Grandal,,,They had Luis 3rd so my bet is they keep him there. Eloy takes Jose's spot at cleanup. Beni must have been signed for a reason so he takes the empty spot in the top 2. Moncada/Garcia were consistently 6/7 last year.
CLE,Steven Kwan,Amed Rosario,Jose Ramirez,Josh Bell,Josh Naylor,Andres Gimenez,Oscar Gonzalez,Mike Zunino,Myles Straw,,,Looks like CLE was batting Rosario/Ramirez 2/3 consistently which makes sense. Kwan they want leading off and he is fast and young with a decent average. I bet they slot Bell into cleanup and move Naylor back to 5th. Looks like they put Straw consistently 9th behind their catcher as a double leadoff thing.
DET,Riley Greene,Javier Baez,Austin Meadows,Spencer Torkelson,Jonathan Schoop,Kerry Carpenter,Akil Baddoo,Ryan Kreidler,Eric Haase,,,"Baez 2 and Meadows 3, Schoop 5 seems like a lock. Riley/Torkelson/Baddoo are fighting for leadoff with Torkelson the backup cleanup hitter to Carpenter. Baddoo seems the most likely to sink."
KC,MJ Melendez,Bobby Witt Jr.,Salvador Perez,Vinnie Pasquantino,Edward Olivares,Hunter Dozier,Michael Massey,Michael A. Taylor,Nicky Lopez,Adalberto Mondei,,Lots of Melendez 1 and Witt 2 ending 2022. Perez was consistent #3. They hate Dozier and Taylor and bury them. Vinnie and Olivares jumped around 3-5. I give Vinnie the cleanup nod.
MIN,Luis Arraez,Carlos Correa,Jorge Polanco,Jose Miranda,Max Kepler,Byron Buxton,Joey Gallo,Alex Kirilloff,Christian Vazquez,,,"Luis, Carlos, Miranda, Max was the most common 1-4. I think Polanco slots into the 3 spot on average a lot pushing Miranda and Kepler down. Buxton defaults to 6 as they want him high but he doesn't play all the games. Gallo, Kirilloff, Vazquez seems like the 7-9. "
BAL,Cedric Mullins II,Adley Rutschman,Ryan Mountcastle,Anthony Santander,Austin Hays,Gunnar Henderson,Adam Frazier,Kyle Stowers,Jorge Mateo,Franchy Cordero,,"Tough one with all the kids and their propensity to change the order for LHP/RHP. Looks like they want Mullins 1, Audley 2, and Santender 4. My bet is the keep trying to make Mountcastle a thing and Hays gets to #5. Frazier they batted 7 last year. The rest is a crapshoot."
BOS,Enrique Hernandez,Rafael Devers,Justin Turner,Alex Verdugo,Masataka Yoshida,Adam Duvall,Christian Arroyo,Triston Casas,Reese McGuire,Trevor Story,Bobby Balbec,I'm guessing Adam Duvall gets the nod over Dalbec. Mostly agree otherwise.
NYY,DJ LeMahieu,Aaron Judge,Gleyber Torres,Anthony Rizzo,Giancarlo Stanton,Oswald Peraza,Aaron Hicks,Harrison Bader,Jose Trevino,Isiah Kiner-Falefa,Oswaldo Cabrera,I think they stick with Hicks and I'm assuming that Jurdge will stay high in the order.
TB,Yandy Diaz,Wander Franco,Randy Arozarena,Brandon Lowe,Harold Ramirez,Manuel Margot,Jonathan Aranda,Christian Bethancourt,Jose Siri,,,"Rays love batting Yandy 1, Wander 2, and Randy 3. My guess is Lowe returning from injury is better aligned with power than speed. Lots of folks have Harold as the cleanup, I'm fine with him protecting cleanup."
TOR,George Springer,Bo Bichette,Vladimir Guerrero Jr.,Matt Chapman,Alejandro Kirk,Whit Merrifield,Kevin Kiermaier,Daulton Varsho,Danny Jansen,,,"They want Springer, Bo, Vlad 123, seems like the bounce Chapman and Kirk around a lot but load them into the first 5 plenty. Forecast is for Merrifield burried, which I thinkis right... until Springer gets hurt. 6 seems like a good hedge for leadoff upside."
HOU,Jose Altuve,Jeremy Pena,Alex Bregman,Jose Abreu,Yordan Alvarez,Kyle Tucker,Michael Brantley,Chas McCormick,Martin Maldonado,,,"I like your assumed 1-4, is we switch Pena in... case to be made for Alvarez at cleanup but come on, Jose will put his foot down. That being said, Alvarez is more of a #5 which bumps Kyle to 6. Brantley has to move down for injury risk."
LAA,Taylor Ward,Mike Trout,Shohei Ohtani,Anthony Rendon,Hunter Renfroe,Brandon Drury,Gio Urshela,Luis Rengifo,Max Stassi,David Fletcher,Mickey Moniak,"Ward was their leadoff guy, assume he'll start there this year. Renfroe is a perfect #5, my guess is Brury is given more at bats than Gio."
OAK,Aledmys Diaz,Ramon Laureano,Jace Peterson,Seth Brown,Jordan Diaz,Conner Capel,Esteury Ruiz,Nick Allen,Shea Langeliers,,,"Not many changes... Lots of love for Jace but Ramon batted 2nd 43 times last year, my bet is they keep him there. Bold call on leaving Kemp off and putting DIaz #1, I'll take it. Bumped Capel up to 6 as I think he's the sureset of them, but it's clearly a crapshoot. "
SEA,Julio Rodriguez,Ty France,Teoscar Hernandez,Eugenio Suarez,J.P. Crawford,Kolten Wong,Jarred Kelenic,Dylan Moore,Cal Raleigh,,,"Julio 1, yep. I think your 2-4 was crazy. They want France 2. Hernandez seems like a decent choice for 3. Suarez has the power for 4. From there I slotted everyone you had down. Crawford was played everywhere so 5 makes sense in that regard. Rotowire has Wong 6 by happy accident. They also want Cal @5 but I think default of catcher last makes sense."
TEX,Marcus Semien,Corey Seager,Nathaniel Lowe,Adolis Garcia,Josh Jung,Josh Smith,Jonah Heim,Leody Taveras,Bubba Thompson,Mitch Garver,,"Why do you hate Nataniel Lowe? Consistenty their 3 while Garcia was 4. The 3 Js were all over the place, but I think Jung has the pop for 5. I like you shoehorning Bubba in, but let's be more realistic. My guess is Heim over Garver. "
CHC,Dansby Swanson,Cody Bellinger,Seiya Suzuki,Trey Mancini,Patrick Wisdom,Ian Happ,Nico Heorner,Matt Mervis,Tucker Barnhart,Nick Madrigal,Nelson Velazquez,Less to pull from historical record so I like your lineup. Switched Suzuki and Mancini because Mancini is more of a cleanup hitter. Suzuki ended the season 2/3 a lot.
CIN,Jonathan India,Nick Senzel,Joey Votto,Wil Myers,Tyler Stephenson,Nick Solak,Jake Fraley,Jose Barrero,Spencer Steer,,,"This is the Senzel year! Reds had him mostly at 6 last year, but I like the bold call. Myers at 4 seems bold too... but the likliest cleanup hitter is Stephenson and he is a C who only got 50 games last year. I moved him to 5."
MIL,Willy Adames,Christian Yelich,Jesse Winker,Rowdy Tellez,Keston Hiura,Luis Urias,Garrett Mitchell,Tyrone Taylor,William Contreras,Brian Anderson,Owen Miller,"I'm pretty sure Adames will be 2 more often than 1, but I think in the grand scheme putting him 1 is the right call. I'm seeing Brian Anderson listed as 6 and Urias as 9 but I think Hiura will come back and I like your Urias love."
PIT,Oneil Cruz,Bryan Reynolds,Rodolfo Castro,Carlos Santana,Ke'Bryan Hayes,Ji-Man Choi,Jack Suwinski,Cal Mitchell,Austin Hedges,,,"End of season they went with a Cruz, Reynolds, Castro order. Hayes is clearly the man out. They played him 5 a lot down the stretch, so I slotted him there after Sanatana and before Choi."
STL,Tommy Edman,Paul Goldschmidt,Nolan Arenado,Lars Nootbaar,Brendan Donovan,Tyler O'Neill,Juan Yepez,Dylan Carlson,Willson Contreras,,,"We'll need to watch Nootbaar, Donovan, and Yepez. I think STL wants Goldie and Arenado 3 then 4 (slotted them 2, 3 because they will more consistently get PAs)  so those three have a lot of upside as either jumping into the 2 hole or batting cleanup. "
ATL,Ozzie Albies,Ronald Acuna Jr.,Austin Riley,Matt Olson,Michael Harris II,Eddie Rosario,Marcell Ozuna,Sean Murphy,Vaughn Grissom,Orlando Arcia,Travis d'Arnaud,"I hope Albies resumes the leadoff role... Harris will not be the 5, but I think it'll be about his average position as he jumps around. I think Ozuna gets buried. "
MIA,Jazz Chisholm Jr.,Jon Berti,Joey Wendle,Jorge Soler,Avisail Garcia,Jean Segura,Garrett Cooper,Bryan De La Cruz,Jacob Stallings,,,Boy did they like leading off Berti last year... I bet he gets some nods at 1. I'll default with you on the rest.
NYM,Brandon Nimmo,Starling Marte,Francisco Lindor,Pete Alonso,Daniel Vogelback,Jeff McNeil,Mark Canha,Eduardo Escobar,Omar Narvaez,,,This was the lineup for game 133 subing in Omar at C.
PHI,Trea Turner,Kyle Schwarber,Rhys Hoskins,Nick Castellanos,Alec Bohm,J.T. Realmuto,Bryson Stott,Nick Maton,Brandon Marsh,Darick Hall,,"Philly likes Schwarber then Hoskins. Realmuto is their cleanup hitter, but I love your Bohm love and let's assume he gets more PA merely by not being a catcher. Don't care about the rest of them. Apparently Darick Hall might be more of a thing than Nick Maton. "
WSH,Lane Thomas,CJ Abrams,Joey Meneses,Victor Robles,Jeimer Candelario,Luis Garcia,Alex Call,Ildemaro Vargas,Keibert Ruiz,,,"They bury Robles, so I pushed him down. They also like going Thomas, Abras, Meneses so I dropped them into the 1-3."
AZ,Jake McCarthy,Ketel Marte,Lourdes Gurriel Jr.,Christian Walker,Josh Rojas,Corbin Carroll,Geraldo Perdomo,Gabriel Moreno,Nick Ahmed,Pavin Smith,Evan Longoria,"Ketel Marte and 5 guys who should all bat 5th or 6th... What a team. I'm on the McCarthy train. I think Lourdes makes a comeback in the dessert, and I think Christian is cleanup. Rojas and Carroll are the odd men out."
COL,Ryan McMahon,Kris Bryant,Charlie Blackmon,C.J. Cron,Brendan Rodgers,Randal Grichuk,Michael Toglia,Ezequiel Tovar,Elias Dias,,,"Hardy optimism for McMahon but he did bat first down the stretch a fair bit. My guess is they want a lot of Bryant and Blackmon PAs. Last stand for Blackon? Rodgers and Grichuk it in perpetual ""almost relevant"" land."
LAD,Mookie Betts,Freddie Freeman,Max Muncy,Will Smith,J.D. Martinez,Gavin Lux,Trayce Thompson,Chris Taylor,Miguel Vargas,,,They played Smith cleanup a lot last year. Muncy and Marinez are both 5s... I don't think they'll trust Lux in the 1-4...
SD,Trent Grisham,Juan Soto,Manny Machado,Xander Bogaerts,Nelson Cruz,Jake Cronenworth,Matt Carpenter,Ha-Seong Kim,Austin Nola,Fernando Tatis Jr.,Luis Campusano,Flipped Soto and Bogaerts - really you would want more Soto PAs. Also added Cruz to 5 which seems automatic. I think Grisham/Cronenworth/Kim are the likliest leadoff candidates. going Grisham really tilts the scales as saying we think he's the most valuable.
SF,Thairo Estrada,Mike Yastrzemski,Mitch Haniger,Joc Pederson,Michael Conforto,Wilmer Flores,Brandon Crawford,David Villar,Joey Bart,,,I'm on the Estrada train this year though you know I hate sophomore slumps. Seems like this one is a big shrug so I mostly stuck with the favorite order from last year subbing in the new guys and moving Estrada up.
